                <h3>How long does a job take?</h3>
                <p>
                    Each concrete job varies, depending on the size and complexity. A patio or driveway normally takes about a week to a week and a half. Other projects that involve pool installation, decks, gazebos, and landscaping can vary greatly.

                <h3>Do I need to be home? How do I prepare for your arrival?</h3>
                <p>
                You do not need to be present while we are working, but we may need access to a water source (hose hookup), and sometimes electricity (power outlet or extension cord). You should also mark any utility objects that you are aware of, such as sprinklers or utility lines.</p>

                <h3>How deep do you dig?</h3>
                <p>
                    
                A concrete patio will be excavated for 4 inches of concrete and about 4 inches of base for a total depth of 7 to 8 inches.</p>

                <h3>Will there be damage to my yard?</h3>
                <p>
                    Small projects don't cause damage. Larger projects require equipment and trucks that can damage yards, however we will do our best to repair any damage, and leave the job site in great condition.

                <h3>Will the concrete crack or break?</h3>
                <p>
                    Your project should last for many years, but concrete can crack over time. We use a combination of proven techniques to help prevent cracking, including the use of quality concrete, compactive road base, rebar or wire mesh, and extension joints.

                <h3>Should I use salt to melt snow and ice in the winter?</h3>
                <p>
                No. Use sand only! Salt can damage the color and sealer used on your concrete. You can remove snow with a plastic shovel (not metal) or use a snow blower.

                <h3>Will the color fade over time?</h3>
                <p>
                    
                Over time, weathering can occur, and your stamped or stained concrete can wear and the colors can dull. Sealing your concrete minimizes color fading. However we recommend periodically cleaning and resealing the concrete every 2-3 years. This will keep your project looking beautiful.

                <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                <p>
                    Our jobs are estimated and based on many factors including the size (footage), style, preparation of the site, removal of objects, and installation time. Just like any other construction job, we can provide you with a free estimate for your project. Contact us anytime for details.
