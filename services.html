                You do not need to be present while we are working, but we may need access to a water source (hose hookup), and sometimes electricity (power outlet or extension cord). You should also mark any utility objects that you are aware of, such as sprinklers or utility lines.</p>

                No. Use sand only! Salt can damage the color and sealer used on your concrete. You can remove snow with a plastic shovel (not metal) or use a snow blower.

Performance Guideline:Except for basement floors or where a floor or portion of floor has been designed for specific drainage purposes, concrete floors in rooms designed for habitability shall not have pits, depressions, or areas of unevenness exceeding 3/8 inch in 32 inches.
Corrective Measure:Specialized Concrete Designers will correct or repair to meet the performance guideline.

<br>
<br>

*Specialized Concrete Designers is not liable for concrete cracks caused by water drainage and freezing under concrete pads. Water drainage must be diverted away from concrete.

<br>
<br>
**Use of salts or other de-icing chemicals may damage concrete. Specialized Concrete Designers warns against the use of salt, calcium, chloride, fertilizers, or commercially prepared de-icing chemicals on concrete surfaces. Salts aggravate freeze/thaw damage, causing the concrete surface to  flake  or spall off. Any substance containing ammonium sulfate or ammonium nitrate will chemically destroy the concrete surface. For safety, Specialized Concrete Designers recommends the use of clean traction sand where conditions are icy, as opposed to chemical de-icing. Because some areas use salt on city streets, melt-off of salty slush from your vehicle may also cause damage. Damage caused by de-icing chemicals is not covered by your warranty.
